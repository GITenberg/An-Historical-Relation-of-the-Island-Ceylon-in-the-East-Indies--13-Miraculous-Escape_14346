description: "An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon together With somewhat Concerning\
  \ Severall Remarkable passages of my life that hath hapned since my Deliverance\
  \ out of Captivity is a book written by the English trader and sailor Robert Knox\
  \ in 1681. It describes his experiences some years earlier on the South Asian island\
  \ now best known as Sri Lanka. It provides one of the most important contemporary\
  \ accounts of 17th century Ceylonese life.\nKnox spent 19 years on Ceylon after\
  \ being taken prisoner by King RÃ¢jasimha II. He survived by knitting caps, selling\
  \ goods and lending rice and corn. He finally escaped with one companion in 1679\
  \ and reached Arippu, a Dutch settlement on the north-west coast of the island,\
  \ from where he was able to return to England in 1680.\nThe book was written during\
  \ the voyage to England. It came to the attention of Knox's employers, the directors\
  \ of the British East India Company, who recommended its publication. The historian\
  \ and biographer John Strype, Knox's cousin, helped him to prepare the book for\
  \ publication with the encouragement of the natural philosopher and polymath Robert\
  \ Hooke. It was printed by Richard Chiswell, the printer to the Royal Society, under\
  \ the imprimaturs of the Society and the Company. When the book was published in\
  \ 1681 it was widely read and was translated in Knox's lifetime into German (1689),\
  \ Dutch (1692) and French (1693) editions. It made Knox internationally famous and\
  \ was a major influence on the works of Daniel Defoe; Robinson Crusoe and the later\
  \ Captain Singleton both draw on the experiences of Knox.\n\nThe Relation has a\
  \ wider literary importance in influencing the development of the English novel.\
  \ Knox uses direct and idiomatic language to provide detailed descriptions of the\
  \ factual reality that he saw during his time on Ceylon. He paints a portrait of\
  \ himself as a practical, self-sufficient and robust individual, very much like\
  \ Defoe's shipwrecked mariner. The book is of fundamental importance as a source\
  \ for the economic history and anthropology of Ceylon during this period due to\
  \ the objectivity and detail of the text, in which Knox provides closely observed\
  \ descriptions of Sinhalese topography, economic and social life, cultural characteristics\
  \ and conditions in the kingdom of Kandy. It is divided into four parts; the first\
  \ three describe the kingdom of Kandy, and the final part details Knox's escape\
  \ from captivity.\nThe preface provides maps and descriptions of Tamil royal and\
  \ rural life in the country Vanni which he stumbled into in the north and east of\
  \ the island. The book is accompanied by seventeen copperplate engravings of unknown\
  \ provenance to illustrate topics addressed by Knox. The engravings are not particularly\
  \ artistically accomplished, but they do fit the text well. However, the artist\
  \ suffers from evidently not having seen his subjects; H.A.I. Goonetileke comments\
  \ that \"the animals are near caricatures and the human subjects are obviously based\
  \ on more familiar European models.\" The non-English editions of the book imitate\
  \ or adapt the original English engravings. The Dutch edition, for instance, incorporates\
  \ engravings by Jan Luyken which are based on the English originals but provide\
  \ a more animated setting, with more detailed backgrounds of buildings and landscapes.\n\
